Below is a collection of videos that I produced throughout the course. </p>\n<p>The first bit was on an algorithm called CCA, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_cellular_automaton\">Cyclic Cellular Automata</a>. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWh-WrAOFW8\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p>The next week we covered more traditional Cellular Automata as might be seen in <a href=\"https://www.stephenwolfram.com/\">Stephen Wolfram</a>'s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Kind-Science-Stephen-Wolfram/dp/1579550088\">A New Kind of Science</a></p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUzwEvYhFGQ\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p>And here is a project with agents who move about by following trails left behind by the others, similar to ants. This is called <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6357972\">Stigmergy</a>. It's also been recognized as a way slime molds propagate, as presented by <a href=\"https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-jeff-jones\">Professor Jeff Jones</a>. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPVjOzcE5UE\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p>Next up was the classic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids\">Boids</a> flocking algorithm, but we could really push the numbers like in the prior stigmergy example. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n0PcN0K8EVI\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p>All of these prior examples had the compute shader outputting a texture which was then put on a plane in Unity. Next, we dove into the fastest geometry instancing method in Unity, <a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect.html\">DrawMeshInstancedIndirect</a>. The first thing we did with this was to make a boatload of cubes and then drive them with one of the prior projects. This one below is driven with the CCA algorithm. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3ZsTteb4ho\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p>And now that we've gotten familiar with drawing hundreds of thousands of cubes in 3D space, we adapted the boids routine to 3D. This required some ingenuity as the course did not spell it out explicitly. The trickiest part was using a 3D texture to store positions and velocities, and then using that for neighbor finding. This was basically the final test.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0ZlxL_eIWs\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Once the course was over, I went back to see if I could implement <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">Conway's Game of Life</a> on my own, and it went pretty smoothly. </p>",

How to make a game with two 11 year olds</h2>\n<p>I've done a number of game jams, both solo and with teams of adults, but I've never done one with two 6th graders. This was different because the most important thing to me was that they had a positive experience. However I also know that most jams, especially for first timers, are disasters! So managing expectations was key.</p>\n<p>The first thing I did was ask them what they wanted to get out of it. My son, Elliot, said his priority was to finish and to make something that did well in the jam rankings. His friend Kaung just wanted to have fun. So I took that as my challenge, to execute on their goals and make this feel like their game.</p>\n<p>Next we figured out roles and responsibilities. Kaung has a way with words and is always making us laugh on Discord, so we wanted the game to have writing to support his skill. Luckily he is also quite technical and has run his own modded Minecraft server, coded in Visual Studio, and installed a number of ridiculous Discord Bots.</p>\n<p>Elliot can do quite a bit in game development already including programming, art, sound, music, and design. He'd published two Itch games on his own before this, <a href=\"https://captainexpo.itch.io/acorn-hunt\">Acorn Hunt</a> and <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null\" title=\"https://captainexpo.itch.io/seat-labor\">Seat Labor.</a> He's an aspiring game maker just like his dad. Yes I am still aspiring too.</p>\n<p>So Elliot opted to focus on the art and music. That left me to do the programming and the organization. We made a little chart in Miro.com, which we used for our brainstorming. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/Screenshot-2021-03-13-143822.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-13-143822-xs.png 300w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-13-143822-sm.png 480w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-13-143822-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1543\" height=\"1024\"></figure>\n<h3>Time is precious</h3>\n<p>The first thing we did was figure out how much time we had to work with. We used a unit of 1 day and walked through the week for each worker. It turned out that between school, work, and life, we each had about 3 full workdays for the 7 day jam. This set expectations on scope early. This also set up some accountability and expectations which were important to a new team.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/Screenshot-2021-03-13-144118.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-13-144118-xs.png 300w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-13-144118-sm.png 480w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-13-144118-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"Schedule\" width=\"1364\" height=\"727\"></figure>\n<h3>Choosing the design</h3>\n<p>We all pitched ideas that we wanted to do in the time we had. Some of the ideas were a bit big at first, but Elliot's experience with shipping his own games helped him to reign it in. Ultimately we had two designs to choose from that captured all of our skills and seemed doable.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/Screenshot-2021-03-13-153356.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-13-153356-xs.png 300w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-13-153356-sm.png 480w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-13-153356-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1437\" height=\"744\"></figure>\n<p>Both of these ideas seemed to work for our team. We sat on it for a few days, but then the theme was announced for the jam. It was \"Stronger Together\". The boys immediately saw how Bowling For Monsters was a better fit for the theme, so we went that way. Someday I'd like to come back to Skydiving Poet.</p>\n<h3>Tools and Pipelines</h3>\n<p>I felt like my biggest challenge, after picking a design that the boys felt invested in, was to figure out how they could work effectively without me. Art wasn't a big concern, becuase Elliot has his preferred tools already (Pixilart.com is his favorite). The writing was the thing. At first I thought we'd just set up a Google Sheet for Kaung, but after talking to <a href=\"twitter.com/ekanaut\">Eka</a> I learned about <a href=\"https://yarnspinner.dev/\">Yarn Spinner</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/Screenshot-2021-03-20-110302.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-110302-xs.png 300w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-110302-sm.png 480w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-110302-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"Yarn Editor\" width=\"1282\" height=\"1020\"></figure>\n<p>Yarn Spinner handles branching dialogue, setting variables, localization, and way more. After doing this project I'd use it again. The Unity integration is particularly neat, as they made a custom importer for .yarn files. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/Screenshot-2021-03-20-110750.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-110750-xs.png 300w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-110750-sm.png 480w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-110750-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"Yarn Importer in Unity\" width=\"797\" height=\"793\"></figure>\n<p>It also comes with a Unity UI setup for displaying the dialogue in game, which I pretty much just used as is with a few tweaks.</p>\n<p>So Kaung was able to just hammer on stuff in the Yarn Editor and test in Unity without needing the game to work. He wrote some ridiculous stuff too. It was really fun to see what he did once his tools were working. We got tripped up a bit by the restriction that all Yarn nodes must be uniquely named. They all get loaded into a giant pile at game start. Once we figured that out and made each node &lt;Character&gt;.&lt;Thing&gt; that worked. </p>\n<h3>The Bowling Problem</h3>\n<p>Most of this project was pretty easy from the programming perspective. I just set up a loop between the bowling and dialogue segments using a simple state machine that used coroutines to sequence their transitions. The bowling segment though, presented a few challenges.</p>\n<p>The first issue was that the art style Elliot was doing was pretty low resolution pixel art. I had to figure out how to match this while still using 3D physics. He ended up drawing the alley art in perspective and so I just decided I would overlay some 3D objects and use a rendertexture to downres them. It worked nicely. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/Screenshot-2021-03-20-111919.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-111919-xs.png 300w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-111919-sm.png 480w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-111919-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"Bowling as Rendertexture\" width=\"1356\" height=\"912\"></figure>\n<p>So, getting bowling going artistically and mechanically was about a day for me. However I still didn't understand how scoring worked in bowling. Even worse, once I DID think I understood it, I still didn't understand it!</p>\n<h3>Bowling Scoring is a Sick Joke</h3>\n<p>OK ok I know that sounds extreme, but there is a reason that bowling scoring is used as a programming test on job interviews. It's an interesting problem that seems simple but is not. This has really cluttered the internet with bad takes. Just try Googling it. You'll find every manner of overengineered Java solutions with a class for every aspect of the frame. All I wanted was a simple function that would take in an array of frames and calculate the score! Eventually I found something on StackOverflow that looked good.</p>\n<p>Thankfully after a lot of searching, the user <a href=\"https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/105198/rainer-p\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ranier P</a> posted at the bottom of <a href=\"https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/209960/calculate-the-score-of-a-bowling-game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this Stack Overflow thread</a> and included a simple C# extension method that is the essence of scoring bowling:</p>\n<p><code></code></p>\n<pre>//C# List extensions method to calculate score<br>public static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; Scores(this IList&lt;int&gt; pins)<br>{<br>   // Walk the list in steps of two rolls (= one frame)<br>   for (int i = 0; i + 1 &lt; pins.Count; i += 2)<br>   {<br>      // Neither strike nor spare<br>      if (pins[i] + pins[i + 1] &lt; 10)<br>      {<br>         yield return pins[i] + pins[i + 1];<br>         continue;<br>      }<br><br>      // Score can only be determined if third roll is available<br>      if (i + 2 &gt;= pins.Count)<br>         yield break;<br><br>      yield return pins[i] + pins[i + 1] + pins[i + 2];<br><br>      // In case of strike, advance only by one<br>      if (pins[i] == 10)<br>         i--;<br>   }<br>}<br><br>//economical storage and methods for each roll<br>public class BowlingScoring<br>{<br>   private List&lt;int&gt; pins = new List&lt;int&gt;();<br>   public void Roll(int n) =&gt; pins.Add(n);<br>   public void SetRoll(int idx, int score) =&gt; pins[idx] = score;<br>   public void Clear() =&gt; pins.Clear();<br>   public int Score(int frame) =&gt; pins.Scores().Take(frame).Sum();<br>}</pre>\n<p><code></code></p>\n<p>Now, you'd think that would do it, and I'd be done. But NO, a fundamental misunderstanding held me up. See, I didn't realize that in bowling (10 pin bowling that is), the scoring is based on ROLLS not FRAMES. The difference is that every frame does NOT have two rolls. I mistakenly thought that a strike was a roll of 10 and then an automatic roll of 0 after to fill the frame. This is wrong. A strike makes a frame have one roll. Once you understand this, it becomes apparent how a 300 game is possible. Each strike looks ahead two rolls, so in the case of three strikes in a row, the first frame resolves as 30. Thus, 10 frames that look ahead two frames to strikes yields 10 x 30 or 300.</p>\n<p>I did not understand this and it cost me a lot of time.</p>\n<p>Now, this just gets you the calculated score for each frame. It does not tell your UI how to present the frames. This was a whole other problem. You've got to draw an X if it's a strike, a / if it's a spare, and hold a blank frame if the strike or spare isn't resolved yet. Unfortunately I didn't figure out some simple way to do this and just beat it into submission by building a UI that updated on OnValidate and then I just entered values into the rolls list in the inspector until I couldn't break it.</p>\n<p>In its entirety, the bowling scoring system took me well over a day and I didn't even finish it on time for the jam. So after all that prep I was the one that ended up missing the mark! Nice lesson for the boys there.</p>\n<h3>Jam Submission</h3>\n<p>So we worked pretty casually during the week, which meant our final day, Saturday, was a rush. Of course, this meant that there were integration issues as we stuffed content into the game at the last minute... but the game was fun and funny! The characters had a lot of personality and the writing was full of surprises. Elliot even wrote a custom music loop for each character. His music for the bowling roll was also timed perfectly on the first try.</p>\n<p>Pretty close to the end we started implementing the ability system, which was where monsters would give you special bowling abilities after a conversation. We ended up finishing BIG BALL, QUICKSHOT, and PERFECT TIMING, each of which were quite fun to see. </p>\n<p>The boys worked really hard the last day and we managed to get the game submitted with a few minutes to spare. The feedback was great! Here's the jam submission link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5/rate/928181\">https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5/rate/928181</a></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/Screenshot-2021-03-20-120617.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-120617-xs.png 300w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-120617-sm.png 480w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/13/responsive/Screenshot-2021-03-20-120617-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"Itch Submission Page\" width=\"803\" height=\"572\"></figure>\n<p>This was pretty good for a first time submission from a group with two sixth graders! There were 1,885 entries in the jam, so this put team Cheesebucket in the top third. I'll take it.</p>\n<h3>Lessons</h3>\n<p>I think our team learned that you have to get done with your game at least a day early in a weeklong jam, so you can test test test and polish. While I put in a few solid days during the week (mainly because I was stressed that I would be the one that held the team up), the boys didn't do much during the school week. That rush on Friday and Saturday left us tired and sloppy (even me). So aiming to finish the game on Thursday or Friday would have been ideal, with a sense of urgency throughout the week. Granted, that is tough when you have jobs and school, but \"sleep when you're dead\" is what my Dad says.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, we hit on the boys goals of A) Finishing and B) Having Fun.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://captainexpo.itch.io/bowling-for-monsters\">Click here to play Bowling for Monsters in your browser on Itch.io</a><a href=\"https://captainexpo.itch.io/bowling-for-monsters\"></a><a href=\"https://captainexpo.itch.io/bowling-for-monsters\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

As a developer of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWotJ_-zgU\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWotJ_-zgU\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">VR game</a> I do not <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">want</em> VR to fail, obviously. My decision to build a launch title for PS4's Project Morpheus VR headset also illustrates that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I don’t think it will fail.</em> I’ve been making games for 15 years and I really do have high hopes for VR. </p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">However, I will also admit and even embrace that I don’t really know <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what</em> will happen with VR. There are too many dynamics at play and so much we do not understand. We have not seen an invention as significant as VR since, well, probably the iPhone but more likely moving pictures. </p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The reason I’m writing this though is because I think Walker’s article deserves a long form response from someone working in VR every day.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">VR is a new medium. It begs for new creations to be made specifically for it. The ultimate failure of 3D Television is a point of comparison in the article. The problem with this is that 3DTV is not a medium but simply a new way of viewing an existing one. I am not aware of a single creative work that was fundamentally authored for only 3DTV such that it was not also viewable on a 2D TV. That technology is augmentative rather than transformative. Experiencing VR content on the other hand is fundamentally different and often mutually exclusive from standard TV. 3DTV and VR actually have little in common and the article’s point should be disregarded.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The line “VR replaces the role of the imagination” from the article is just as absurd as saying the same about photography, theatre, conversation and people. These are elements of experience that fall outside of a traditional screen and are quite comfortable there. The line in context gives games on standard screens exclusive domain over our imaginations. Nobody would argue that point in isolation and it doesn’t make any more sense as part of this article about VR.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Then there’s the point on price, which is deftly paired with the categorization of VR as a peripheral. You can say that all you want, but a VR headset is no more a peripheral than your television is. It is a brand new doorway through which you can step through. For that matter, many people will look at the headset as the focal point and the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">computer as the peripheral</em>. That’s how much more important it is than what’s typically thought of as a peripheral like a Wii Fit. How much did your TV cost? </p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">And then we come to the crescendo of the piece — the complaint that despite all that was written, it is actually about the games. His logic is that there will not be enough AAA VR games because of risk, standard games will get half-hearted VR modes, and the medium will die a quick death because it never reaches critical mass. He says there will be small indie games but Kinect had that too and look what difference it made.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Well try this on then. Let’s say that critical mass actually does <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not come from AAA games.</em> Let’s say it comes from somewhere completely unexpected. Maybe social VR ends up being unbelievably new and amazing. Maybe watching films in VR gains enough mass market traction. Maybe some indie does something amazing that gains critical mass (can you imagine???). It’s likely going to be a combination and interaction of all of these and more. </p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The one thing that I REALLY REALLY believe is that VR is totally new and we are just getting started with it. Remember when the iPhone came out and multitouch screens weren’t completely understood? Then Angry Birds became a cultural phenomenon. This is like that times a hundred. Remember when the iPad was announced and everyone complained it was just a bigger iPhone? This is like that times a hundred. </p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Most people cannot imagine what a new technology will bring them until it is demonstrated over and over again, often times refined and advertised and refined again. VR is so early. So if you want to say VR is risky, that nobody knows what VR is going to be like in 3 or 5 years… well I’m with you. We don’t. </p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">What I do absolutely know is that now that I am in the throes of developing in VR, the possiblities feel so vast and so interesting, how could you not <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">want</em> it to succeed? It’s as if we just discovered a new planet that could bear life. Why hope it leads to nothing? What’s the point of rooting against VR? That’s what I’d really like the gaming press to write about.</p>",
