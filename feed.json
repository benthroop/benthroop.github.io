He came back on Saturday and played three more times, getting first place on his last ball.

Andreas Johnsson of <a href=\"http://www.tarsierstudios.com/\" class=\"bx dm jt ju jv jw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tarsier Studios</a> (<a href=\"http://statik.institute/\" class=\"bx dm jt ju jv jw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Statik</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review\" class=\"bx dm jt ju jv jw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Little Nightmares</a>) and I improved diplomatic relations between the USA and Sweden by exchanging our currencies. It was funny, just a couple days ago we were talking on Skype about Gamedev Things™ and realized we both have been carrying these notes around since then and both of us, at that moment, had no other cash. He has a $2 bill and I have this 20 Kronor note.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3264/1*ylPUJkmDJT_1T4TxW_POXg.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Image for post\"></p>\n<p id=\"5a39\" class=\"ja jb bj jc b jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js hd cx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I was also fortunate to get to know <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IlariHMQ\" class=\"bx dm jt ju jv jw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ilari Kuittinen</a> of <a href=\"https://www.housemarque.com/\" class=\"bx dm jt ju jv jw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Housemarque </a>(Alienation, Resogun) who had just started to talk about his studio’s collaboration with Eugene Jarvis on what has now been announced as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DeoMXhzypU\" class=\"bx dm jt ju jv jw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nex Machina.</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"6885\" class=\"kv kw bj bi ga kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm cx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Match Day 2016</h1>\n<p id=\"8761\" class=\"ja jb bj jc b jd ln jf jg lo ji jj lp jl jm lq jo jp lr jr js hd cx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">On match day, we arrived at Milan’s San Siro stadium early for some food and drink in the Playstation FC Hospitality area, which also had a station for people to play Headmaster. I caught this shakycam footage of a stroll around the place, ending with some folks gawking at an unsuspecting player making a go of it.</p>\n<figure class=\"jy jz ka kb kc kd\">\n<div class=\"kk r cp\">\n<div class=\"ls km r\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FJI8Dkd0kjK4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJI8Dkd0kjK4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FJI8Dkd0kjK4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Headmaster at Playstation FC in Milan 2016\" class=\"s t u fa ai\" scrolling=\"auto\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"kr ks gz gx gy kt ku bi el cn bk bn\">Headmaster being played inside the Playstation FC Hospitality Tent</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"d085\" class=\"ja jb bj jc b jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js hd cx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">After pregaming in this area for a few hours, we made our way to our seats and this is where I started to get really excited. I’m a pretty avid fan and this is just a huge match in a huge stadium. I am quite sure was built with alien technology. It is enormous.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1843/1*O0UYi0QfpdsuXuR9mbmXhA.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Image for post\"></p>\n<p id=\"210f\" class=\"ja jb bj jc b jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js hd cx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">And below is a video which is an attempt to capture the vibe of walking into the stadium. On the left of the frame you’ll see Andreas and Ilari, along with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/iamguyceratops\" class=\"bx dm jt ju jv jw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Guy Richards</a> (now of XBox) making fun of me for holding my phone on top of my head but I GOT THIS VIDEO NOW HOW YA LIKE THAT! The audio in this clip brings back some great memories and hopefully it captures a fraction of what it’s like to be met with a wall of 80,000 chanting fans.</p>\n<figure class=\"jy jz ka kb kc kd\">\n<div class=\"kk r cp\">\n<div class=\"lu km r\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGAWVgG1jSyI&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FGAWVgG1jSyI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=youtube\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Headmaster - Milan 2016 Stadium Entrance\" class=\"s t u fa ai\" scrolling=\"auto\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>",
