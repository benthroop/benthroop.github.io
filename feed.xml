<p>TL;DR: On Github, I posted a GPU Animation package that you can get <a href="https://github.com/benthroop/GPUAnimator">HERE</a>.</p>
<h3>GPU Animation For Many Characters</h3>
<p>When you want to draw a LOT of characters at once, using Skinned Meshes in Unity quickly hits a performance wall. You could probably get away with 100, but 1000 will be death. There is a solution though. Instead of using bones, you can use a shader to animate the vertices. Each vertex gets associated with a pixel on a texture which was sampled from the original animations. </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/20/AnimatedTex.apng" alt="" width="762" height="264"></figure>
<p>So each row represents all the vertices on the model. And then along the Y axis we've got time, broken up in to a section for each animation. Just sample the correct pixel's RGB, treat that as XYZ and you can put the vertex in the right place in a vertex shader.</p>
<p>The problem is that there is no built in way to do this in Unity. </p>
<p>For a while, I've been trying to get by with an Asset Store package called <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/mesh-animator-animate-massive-crowds-26009">Mesh Animator</a>. This tool was first released in 2014 as a CPU based mesh animation tool. Somewhere along the way the author added in a GPU solution and it's quite well done. Unfortunately, the project has accumulated a few tough bugs. The author is kind and responds via email, but ultimately it's just too unwieldy for me to be comfortable moving ahead with.</p>
<h2>Saved by Open Source</h2>
<p>Then the other day I found an open source package on Github called <a href="https://github.com/codewriter-packages/Mesh-Animation">Mesh Animation.</a> It is a complete package but still minimal and elegantly written by <a href="https://github.com/vanifatovvlad">VladV</a>. I love the pipeline. You make a single asset which holds everything - references to animations, materials, and textures. This asset provides the baking interface and even has cool validation functionality courtesy of (the required) <a href="https://github.com/codewriter-packages/Tri-Inspector">Tri Inspector, also by VladV</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/20/MeshAnimatorBakeUI.png" alt="Mesh Animation Bake UI" width="591" height="840" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/20/responsive/MeshAnimatorBakeUI-xs.png 300w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/20/responsive/MeshAnimatorBakeUI-sm.png 480w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/20/responsive/MeshAnimatorBakeUI-md.png 768w"></figure>
<p>While it was a great foundation, I found that when I went to use it, it wasn't quite set up the way I'd like. Luckily it is minimal so making changes wasn't that intimidating. I ended up forking the project and pushing my changes up to Github. My version is called <a href="https://github.com/benthroop/GPUAnimator">GPUAnimator</a>. Let me know if you use it and how it goes.</p>

My goal was to get over 1000 concurrent sheep moving over a realistic terrain on a reasonably good PC. While I've had eyes on making this a full game, I want to share what I'm doing before I get to a final decision on that. It's fun to play with even in this early state, and who knows there it will end up. So here we go!</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Well, as you can see from some other posts on here, and from the title of the site, I am really interested in emergent behavior. The interactions of individuals acting in their own self interest is responsible for so many phenomena we see very day. It's like playing with water - it never gets old even if it's totally familiar. I feel like being able to create this stuff on the computer is super interesting and can lead to a lot of crazy surprises.</p>
<p>Then I was watching the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howl's_Moving_Castle_(film)">Howl's Moving Castle</a> with my family, and I came across this shot:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/16/howlmovingcastle.webp" alt="" width="1023" height="552" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/16/responsive/howlmovingcastle-xs.webp 300w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/16/responsive/howlmovingcastle-sm.webp 480w ,https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/16/responsive/howlmovingcastle-md.webp 768w"></figure>
<p>It just hit me how interesting and beautiful flocks of sheep are. I could see how to do it. So I jumped in.</p>
<h2>Getting Educated</h2>
<p>It turned out to be a deep well. Humans and sheep have a very long and mature relationship so there's quite a bit of information and knowledge out there. One of the most useful resources was this simple site on raising sheep. I love that it was built in Dreamweaver.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sheep101.info">http://www.sheep101.info</a></p>
<p>There are also academic papers with super complicated analyses of sheep behavior that are more meant for industry. I felt like starting with Boids would work.</p>
<h2>Boids</h2>
<p>A flock, whether it's birds, sheep, or fish, can be represented by a well known and elegant algorithm called Boids (<a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">Reynolds 1986</a>). </p>
<p>In the Boids algorithm, we determine the movement of each individual <em>agent </em>by observing its <em>neighbors</em> to calculate <em>forces.</em> These forces represent the agent's desire to stay close to other agents (cohesion), but not TOO close (separation). At the same time, each agent wants to move in the same direction as those around them (alignment). Once we balance these three fundamental forces we get interesting and natural behavior out of simple rules. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/16/Boids-Simple-2.gif" alt="" width="300" height="288"></figure>
<p>After the basic forces are set up, most implementations add avoidance so that the agents don't run into obstacles. However, I was most interested in them escaping from a predator such as a dog. After all, that's the basis for herding.</p>
<p>So I put together a basic implementation in Unity. This had cohesion, <span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">alignment, and separation and then after all that was summed up, the escape vector was thrown in. There was no avoidance but since these were rigidbodies, they gracefully slid along the walls and it worked. This also was fine with a few dozen sheep, but as the calculations for boids are O(n^2) it wasn't viable as the final algorithm. I wanted to have hundreds going at once.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://emergentbehavior.com/media/posts/16/First.gif" alt="" width="476" height="296"></figure>
<h2>Up Front Optimizations</h2>
<p>The next step was to figure out how to get the numbers of sheep I wanted. The obvious thing was to make the logic multithreaded using Unity's Jobs System. This works by doing the boids forces calculations in a job so that it can be distributed across the CPU's cores. But there turned out to be a lot more to it than that.</p>
<p>There are bunch of performance intensive functions that needed attention:</p>
<ol>
<li>Neighbor Finding using Overlap Sphere</li>
<li>Ground detection using a raycast</li>
<li>World sensing via raycasts</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Time slicing updates</li>
</ol>

<p>A few months ago a tweet caught my eye. A guy named <a href="https://twitter.com/arsiliath?lang=en">@arsiliath</a> was offering a course described as an "<a href="https://arsiliath.gumroad.com/l/compute-shaders">advanced workshop [that] introduces compute shaders via a series of video tutorials related to biological &amp; physical simulation.</a>" I got on the waiting list for the next session, and got in for the April 2021 workshop. </p>
<p><em>(Update Dec 2021: Arsiliath no longer offers this as a live class, but has moved all the materials into a package on Gumroad you can do at your own pace. I've updated the link above to point there.)</em></p>
<p>It was challenging but the people, content, and coursework were quality. Below is a collection of videos that I produced throughout the course. </p>
<p>The first bit was on an algorithm called CCA, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_cellular_automaton">Cyclic Cellular Automata</a>. </p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWh-WrAOFW8" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>The next week we covered more traditional Cellular Automata as might be seen in <a href="https://www.stephenwolfram.com/">Stephen Wolfram</a>'s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Kind-Science-Stephen-Wolfram/dp/1579550088">A New Kind of Science</a></p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUzwEvYhFGQ" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>And here is a project with agents who move about by following trails left behind by the others, similar to ants. This is called <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6357972">Stigmergy</a>. It's also been recognized as a way slime molds propagate, as presented by <a href="https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-jeff-jones">Professor Jeff Jones</a>. </p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPVjOzcE5UE" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>Next up was the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Boids</a> flocking algorithm, but we could really push the numbers like in the prior stigmergy example. </p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n0PcN0K8EVI" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>All of these prior examples had the compute shader outputting a texture which was then put on a plane in Unity. Next, we dove into the fastest geometry instancing method in Unity, <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect.html">DrawMeshInstancedIndirect</a>. The first thing we did with this was to make a boatload of cubes and then drive them with one of the prior projects. This one below is driven with the CCA algorithm. </p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3ZsTteb4ho" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>And now that we've gotten familiar with drawing hundreds of thousands of cubes in 3D space, we adapted the boids routine to 3D. This required some ingenuity as the course did not spell it out explicitly. The trickiest part was using a 3D texture to store positions and velocities, and then using that for neighbor finding. This was basically the final test.</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0ZlxL_eIWs" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>Once the course was over, I went back to see if I could implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> on my own, and it went pretty smoothly.</p>

Kristin and I happened to visit the booth right around then. We looked over and saw this man with tears in his eyes. We quickly came to find out that he was the winner. It was then that I really understood how precious those tickets were.</p>
<p id="66a7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Chris was from Cardiff and came down to the festival on Friday, played Headmaster a few times, but didn’t quite reach the top of the leaderboard. His first score was 600. He told us he went home that night and couldn’t sleep because he was so consumed with strategizing how to get a higher score. He came back on Saturday and played three more times, getting first place on his last ball. He beat the next closest player by <em class="mu">20 points</em>.<br><br></p>

<p id="1a71" data-selectable-paragraph="">Right after the Tournament ended, it was time to head over to the match. We were a part of Playstation’s group, so we had passes to The Champions Village, which is like an all inclusive mini-resort to hang out at for a couple hours before game time. If there is a polar opposite to tailgating at a Buffalo Bills game, this was it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp8EOHBGl2o" class="bx dm ko kp kq kr" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">These guys have some good video</a> of the experience and make it look appropriately fancy.<br><br></p>

But even better than last year, the fine gents from Playstation Access came by and ran up the scores, recording the whole bit. The video below should go right to the proper time for Headmaster business, but their whole video is another fun look at what it was like to be there at the match.</p>

As a developer of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWotJ_-zgU" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWotJ_-zgU" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VR game</a> I do not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">want</em> VR to fail, obviously. My decision to build a launch title for PS4's Project Morpheus VR headset also illustrates that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I don’t think it will fail.</em> I’ve been making games for 15 years and I really do have high hopes for VR. </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, I will also admit and even embrace that I don’t really know <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what</em> will happen with VR. There are too many dynamics at play and so much we do not understand. We have not seen an invention as significant as VR since, well, probably the iPhone but more likely moving pictures. </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The reason I’m writing this though is because I think Walker’s article deserves a long form response from someone working in VR every day.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">VR is a new medium. It begs for new creations to be made specifically for it. The ultimate failure of 3D Television is a point of comparison in the article. The problem with this is that 3DTV is not a medium but simply a new way of viewing an existing one. I am not aware of a single creative work that was fundamentally authored for only 3DTV such that it was not also viewable on a 2D TV. That technology is augmentative rather than transformative. Experiencing VR content on the other hand is fundamentally different and often mutually exclusive from standard TV. 3DTV and VR actually have little in common and the article’s point should be disregarded.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The line “VR replaces the role of the imagination” from the article is just as absurd as saying the same about photography, theatre, conversation and people. These are elements of experience that fall outside of a traditional screen and are quite comfortable there. The line in context gives games on standard screens exclusive domain over our imaginations. Nobody would argue that point in isolation and it doesn’t make any more sense as part of this article about VR.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Then there’s the point on price, which is deftly paired with the categorization of VR as a peripheral. You can say that all you want, but a VR headset is no more a peripheral than your television is. It is a brand new doorway through which you can step through. For that matter, many people will look at the headset as the focal point and the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">computer as the peripheral</em>. That’s how much more important it is than what’s typically thought of as a peripheral like a Wii Fit. How much did your TV cost? </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">And then we come to the crescendo of the piece — the complaint that despite all that was written, it is actually about the games. His logic is that there will not be enough AAA VR games because of risk, standard games will get half-hearted VR modes, and the medium will die a quick death because it never reaches critical mass. He says there will be small indie games but Kinect had that too and look what difference it made.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Well try this on then. Let’s say that critical mass actually does <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">not come from AAA games.</em> Let’s say it comes from somewhere completely unexpected. Maybe social VR ends up being unbelievably new and amazing. Maybe watching films in VR gains enough mass market traction. Maybe some indie does something amazing that gains critical mass (can you imagine???). It’s likely going to be a combination and interaction of all of these and more. </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The one thing that I REALLY REALLY believe is that VR is totally new and we are just getting started with it. Remember when the iPhone came out and multitouch screens weren’t completely understood? Then Angry Birds became a cultural phenomenon. This is like that times a hundred. Remember when the iPad was announced and everyone complained it was just a bigger iPhone? This is like that times a hundred. </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Most people cannot imagine what a new technology will bring them until it is demonstrated over and over again, often times refined and advertised and refined again. VR is so early. So if you want to say VR is risky, that nobody knows what VR is going to be like in 3 or 5 years… well I’m with you. We don’t. </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">What I do absolutely know is that now that I am in the throes of developing in VR, the possiblities feel so vast and so interesting, how could you not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">want</em> it to succeed? It’s as if we just discovered a new planet that could bear life. Why hope it leads to nothing? What’s the point of rooting against VR? That’s what I’d really like the gaming press to write about.</p>
