<p>I've always wanted to be free with sharing what I'm doing, but there's always been a reason why I didn't. NDAs and employment agreements at Sony and Activision make employees invisible. I left that, but then right after got so deep into making Headmaster that I didn't dedicate the time.</p>
<p>For the past two years I ran an experiment in growing my studio with new talent, but it left me wanting the time to build my own projects. So, here I go. Doing my own stuff again.</p>
<p>It's been a few weeks and I've been tinkering on some code... an old little space shooter project that I'm fixing up like a beat up car. I want to talk about it a bit, so here we go. </p>
<p>BTW this blog is build with a thing called Publii. It's like Wordpress, but the app is on your computer and it generates the site as html/css. It seems cool, so giving it a shot. I gave "fancy" static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo a good look, but you have to be a web head to get these things. Ain't got time for that. </p>
<p>Keeping it fast and loose. </p>
