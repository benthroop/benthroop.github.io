It was a bit of a surprise that they weren't recording the talks, but I was able to cobble together a recording of it anyway.</p><p>This trip was pretty interesting. I went up to Montreal a few days early and got an AirBnB to prep the talk from. I actually liked this approach because I could really concentrate, but it was a bit stressful crunching it together at the last minute.</p><p>Hilariously, my approach was to do a live demo! Did I mention it was stressful to prep? Well the demo itself went well with only one near disaster when I accidentally deleted an essential file in Unity that broke compilation. Somehow my subconscious detected the error and I was able to backtrack and fix it, but for a minute I was dead in the water.</p><p>I mention in the talk that I would post this code to Github, but never got around to doing that. However, here is a link to the projects that I used which you can pull apart. </p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Femergentbehavior.com%2Fmigs-2017-talk-blowing-things-up-in-unity%2F&amp;via=ben_throop&amp;text=MIGS%202017%20Talk%20-%20Blowing%20Things%20up%20in%20Unity" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://emergentbehavior.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div></div></footer></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="http://twitter.com/ben_throop" class="twitter" aria-label="Twitter"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://emergentbehavior.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/benthroop" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://emergentbehavior.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2020 Ben Throop</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://emergentbehavior.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f5b684f5b88f06f52bdfd50819f87ca4"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
