NDAs and employment agreements at Sony and Activision make employees invisible. I left that life in 2015, but right after got so deep into making <a href=\"http://headmastergame.com\">Headmaster</a> that I didn't dedicate the time. I think there is a saying about planting a tree, and yesterday, and something. It's a very smart saying. You can imagine.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I've started to get busy doing my own stuff again. It's exciting and scary, but I'm determined to not hermit again.</p>\n<p>It's been a few weeks and I've been tinkering on some code... an old little space shooter project that I'm fixing up like a beat up car. I want to talk about it a bit, so here we go. </p>\n<p>BTW this blog is built with a thing called <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/\">Publii</a>. It's like Wordpress, but the app is on your computer and it generates the site as html/css. It seems cool, so giving it a shot. I gave \"fancy\" static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo a good look, but you have to be a web head to get these things. Ain't got time for that. </p>\n<p>Let's test a GIF:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://benthroop.github.io/media/posts/1/PARTYMODE-GIF-RobertWheel.gif\" alt=\"\"></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And a Youtube Embed:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4vKQUiiC7jg\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Keeping it fast and loose. </p>",
