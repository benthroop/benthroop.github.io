                <p>It's interesting to reflect on how my taste in games has changed over the years. Back in my 20's, I was into Counterstrike. Nowadays, kids in their 20's are into Counterstrike.</p>
<p>But I've gotten older.</p>
<p>My day is a lot of work. I'm solving problems all the time, in both business and family. How can I get my daughter to eat broccoli? (answer: once she finishes, she gets a pancake). How can I build a game that is both true to myself as a creator and commercially viable? (answer: TBD). How can my wife and I have an intimate and fulfilling relationship when we are literally never alone? (answer: please email me, haven't got this one figured out).</p>
<p>So yeah, once I sit down to "play a game", I've just gotten done playing several games concurrently with varying degrees of success. I don't really want to learn new rules, compete against people who have invested time I'll never have, or, well, in essence, lose. I don't really want to lose. I want to play games that are just fun to play. If they are win or lose games, I want to win. </p>
<p>That means multiplayer games are generally out because humans like winning and everyone can't win. Sorry LIBTARDS! Man what a terrible word that is! But still, it's true. Everyone cannot win unless the game is designed to not be won at all.</p>
<p>That said, some games can only be lost, and somehow that is a happy place to be. Maybe part of reaching this point in life is recognizing that many games are a battle to simply survive. So survival games where eventual death is either lurking over the hill or right on top of you, tend to be quite appealing.</p>

                <p>So yeah I'm using Publii for this and I have been really wringing my hands over it, but today I got editing of the content from multiple computers working well. Publii is like a really stripped down and simplified Wordpress, but instead of requiring an entire stack of server based tech, it is just a program you can install on Windows.</p>
<p>This might seem like a step backwards if you can only edit your stuff from one computer, but fortunately, it's possible to store the source data in Dropbox and sync it between more than one machine. </p>
<p>Anyway I don't really want to make this entire blog about having a blog, but after facing nightmare scenario of using Jekyll and writing posts in Markdown (yeesh), this is amazing.</p>
<p>To make this post not a complete waste, here's the entrance to Unity '09 in San Francisco. Unity spared no expense. I think this was the Unite where they announced a free version.</p>

                <p>I've always wanted to be free with sharing what I'm doing, but there's always been a reason why I didn't. NDAs and employment agreements at Sony and Activision make employees invisible. I left that life in 2015, but right after got so deep into making <a href="http://headmastergame.com">Headmaster</a> that I didn't dedicate the time. I think there is a saying about planting a tree, and yesterday, and something. It's a very smart saying. You can imagine.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've started to get busy doing my own stuff again. It's exciting and scary, but I'm determined to not hermit again.</p>
<p>It's been a few weeks and I've been tinkering on some code... an old little space shooter project that I'm fixing up like a beat up car. I want to talk about it a bit, so here we go. </p>
<p>BTW this blog is built with a thing called <a href="https://getpublii.com/">Publii</a>. It's like Wordpress, but the app is on your computer and it generates the site as html/css. It seems cool, so giving it a shot. I gave "fancy" static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo a good look, but you have to be a web head to get these things. Ain't got time for that. </p>
<p>Let's test a GIF:</p>

Kristin and I happened to visit the booth right around then. We looked over and saw this man with tears in his eyes. We quickly came to find out that he was the winner.

His first score was 600. He told us he went home that night and couldn’t sleep because he was so consumed with strategizing how to get a higher score. He came back on Saturday and played three more times, getting first place on his last ball. He beat the next closest player by <em class="mu">20 points</em>.</p>

But even better than last year, the fine gents from Playstation Access came by and ran up the scores, recording the whole bit.

                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">This post is a backdated record of my trip to Milan for the UEFA Champions League final in 2016, where Headmaster was used as a promotional vehicle for Playstation VR. It was an amazing opportunity I never expected.</p>
<p id="f742" class="ja jb bj jc b jd ln jf jg lo ji jj lp jl jm lq jo jp lr jr js hd cx" data-selectable-paragraph="">The 2016 festival venue was by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Cathedral" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Milan Cathedral</a>, an absolutely gigantic structure with an open square surrounding it. I managed to edit together some iPhone footage of it for posterity.</p>

<p id="799e" class="ja jb bj jc b jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js hd cx" data-selectable-paragraph="">This festival runs for a few days and is pretty much just a giant roiling football party. I spent my time with some other developers who have become good friends. <a href="http://twitter.com/iamguyceratops" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guy Richards</a>, who was at the time our man on the inside of Playstation Europe, was a fantastic host. Andreas Johnsson of <a href="http://www.tarsierstudios.com/" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tarsier Studios</a> (<a href="http://statik.institute/" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Statik</a>, <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares</a>) and I improved diplomatic relations between the USA and Sweden by exchanging our currencies. It was funny, just a couple days ago we were talking on Skype about Gamedev Things™ and realized we both have been carrying these notes around since then and both of us, at that moment, had no other cash. He has a $2 bill and I have this 20 Kronor note.</p>

<p id="5a39" class="ja jb bj jc b jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js hd cx" data-selectable-paragraph="">I was also fortunate to get to know <a href="https://twitter.com/IlariHMQ" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ilari Kuittinen</a> of <a href="https://www.housemarque.com/" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Housemarque </a>(Alienation, Resogun) who had just started to talk about his studio’s collaboration with Eugene Jarvis on what has now been announced as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DeoMXhzypU" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nex Machina.</a></p>

<p id="8761" class="ja jb bj jc b jd ln jf jg lo ji jj lp jl jm lq jo jp lr jr js hd cx" data-selectable-paragraph="">On match day, we arrived at Milan’s San Siro stadium early for some food and drink in the Playstation FC Hospitality area, which also had a station for people to play Headmaster. I caught this shakycam footage of a stroll around the place, ending with some folks gawking at an unsuspecting player making a go of it.</p>

<p id="d085" class="ja jb bj jc b jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js hd cx" data-selectable-paragraph="">After pregaming in this area for a few hours, we made our way to our seats and this is where I started to get really excited. I’m a pretty avid fan and this is just a huge match in a huge stadium. I am quite sure was built with alien technology. It is enormous.</p>

<p id="210f" class="ja jb bj jc b jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js hd cx" data-selectable-paragraph="">And below is a video which is an attempt to capture the vibe of walking into the stadium. On the left of the frame you’ll see Andreas and Ilari, along with <a href="http://twitter.com/iamguyceratops" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guy Richards</a> (now of XBox) making fun of me for holding my phone on top of my head but I GOT THIS VIDEO NOW HOW YA LIKE THAT! The audio in this clip brings back some great memories and hopefully it captures a fraction of what it’s like to be met with a wall of 80,000 chanting fans.</p>
