                <h2>Static Websites Let You Own Your Content.</h2>
<p>This post is about why we got here and what tools are some links to good tools for building static websites.</p>
<hr>
<p>It's 2020 and besides being the year that everything goes wrong, it's also a good time to reflect on how I communicate online. </p>
<p>Years ago we all had websites. Usually we were apologizing for them. Site building was somewhat difficult until Blogger and Wordpress arrived, and then the blogging revolution took off. For a few years, this was a pretty good scene. </p>
<p>Then social media hit. At first, Facebook and Twitter weren't the only places we existed online, but by the mid 2010's, most people had migrated their entire online presence to these platforms. In the process, we abandoned ownership of our content, and in some respects, ourselves.</p>
<p>There's also a different feeling of persistence with social media. It gives you the sensation of creating something, but then you just toss it into a river and watch it float away. </p>
<p>Somewhere in there, Medium launched. Medium is ostensibly a blogging platform, but in practice, it's just Twitter without a word count. They want to put all content behind a wall and own it. </p>
<p>When I've desired to have websites in the last 5 years, I have done my company and game sites on Squarespace. The platform is really easy to use, can scale to any load, and offers a lot of cool functionality. However I couldn't get over the fact that there was no revision history. You could destroy your entire site with one bad edit. The workaround was, get this, to duplicate pages you wanted to edit, and then swap them around when you were ready to publish. That's crazy. </p>
<p>I still host <a href="headmastergame.com">HeadmasterGame.com</a> on there, but for my new <a href="http://frameinteractive.com">FrameInteractive.com</a> site and this one, I wanted to go static and use Git + Github Pages. This would let me freely revise the content and know I could always clean up my mistakes.</p>
<p>For my company site, I chose to just get a website template from <a href="http://html5up.com">html5up.com</a> and edit it. Good old HTML/CSS/JS. Hosting a static site on Github Pages is now free and fast, and one can use Git to iterate on it. This workflow is absolutely great. The only missing bit of server functionality is the contact form, but that's solved by <a href="formspree.com">FormSpree.com</a>, which gives you a snip of HTML to embed and then it takes care of everything. If you've ever dealt with configuring a contact form on a website, you'll know that this is a great service. </p>
<h2>Enter Publii</h2>
<p>This site is built with <a href="https://getpublii.com/">Publii</a>, which is essentially Wordpress as a program that is installed on your local computer. Instead of requiring a webserver with MySQL to serve up the content editing platform, it's just a Windows/Mac app that stores the database locally. I've got it set up so that all of the source data is in Github, and the Publii app has a Github Pages publishing feature, so with one click it regenerates the site and uploads it. It uses a template language called <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars </a>to build the themes, and it's really easy to understand for anyone that's written some code.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>With all this in place, I am going to use Twitter as a broadcasting tool like it should be. Twitter should not be the place we write long thoughts, if for no other reason that we lose them. Tweets are not a body of work. I want to create a body of work here.</p>
<p>Comments are an issue, but a comment is often a desire to talk to the post author as opposed to starting a conversation within a community. So I'll make you a deal. If you write me something really interesting via the <a href="https://emergentbehavior.com/contact/">Contact Form</a> I'll post it back to this page.</p>

<p id="66a7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Chris was from Cardiff and came down to the festival on Friday, played Headmaster a few times, but didn’t quite reach the top of the leaderboard. His first score was 600. He told us he went home that night and couldn’t sleep because he was so consumed with strategizing how to get a higher score. He came back on Saturday and played three more times, getting first place on his last ball. He beat the next closest player by <em class="mu">20 points</em>.<br><br></p>

<p id="1a71" data-selectable-paragraph="">Right after the Tournament ended, it was time to head over to the match. We were a part of Playstation’s group, so we had passes to The Champions Village, which is like an all inclusive mini-resort to hang out at for a couple hours before game time. If there is a polar opposite to tailgating at a Buffalo Bills game, this was it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp8EOHBGl2o" class="bx dm ko kp kq kr" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">These guys have some good video</a> of the experience and make it look appropriately fancy.<br><br></p>

<p id="1ce1" class="jv jw bj jx b jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn hj cx" data-selectable-paragraph="">Just like last year, inside the Champions Village was a Playstation hospitality “tent” with free food, drink, and another Headmaster station. But even better than last year, the fine gents from Playstation Access came by and ran up the scores, recording the whole bit. The video below should go right to the proper time for Headmaster business, but their whole video is another fun look at what it was like to be there at the match.</p>

<p id="799e" class="ja jb bj jc b jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js hd cx" data-selectable-paragraph="">This festival runs for a few days and is pretty much just a giant roiling football party. I spent my time with some other developers who have become good friends. <a href="http://twitter.com/iamguyceratops" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guy Richards</a>, who was at the time our man on the inside of Playstation Europe, was a fantastic host. Andreas Johnsson of <a href="http://www.tarsierstudios.com/" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tarsier Studios</a> (<a href="http://statik.institute/" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Statik</a>, <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares</a>) and I improved diplomatic relations between the USA and Sweden by exchanging our currencies. It was funny, just a couple days ago we were talking on Skype about Gamedev Things™ and realized we both have been carrying these notes around since then and both of us, at that moment, had no other cash. He has a $2 bill and I have this 20 Kronor note.</p>

<p id="5a39" data-selectable-paragraph="">I was also fortunate to get to know <a href="https://twitter.com/IlariHMQ" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ilari Kuittinen</a> of <a href="https://www.housemarque.com/" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Housemarque </a>(Alienation, Resogun) who had just started to talk about his studio’s collaboration with Eugene Jarvis on what has now been announced as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DeoMXhzypU" class="bx dm jt ju jv jw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nex Machina.</a><br><br></p>

<p id="8761" class="ja jb bj jc b jd ln jf jg lo ji jj lp jl jm lq jo jp lr jr js hd cx" data-selectable-paragraph="">On match day, we arrived at Milan’s San Siro stadium early for some food and drink in the Playstation FC Hospitality area, which also had a station for people to play Headmaster. I caught this shakycam footage of a stroll around the place, ending with some folks gawking at an unsuspecting player making a go of it.</p>

I’m a pretty avid fan and this is just a huge match in a huge stadium. I am quite sure was built with alien technology. It is enormous.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p class="graf graf--p"><a href="mailto:john@rockpapershotgun.com" data-href="mailto:john@rockpapershotgun.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">John Walker </strong></a>of Rock Paper Shotgun published an editorial that argued the new VR movement is destined to fail. As a developer of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWotJ_-zgU" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWotJ_-zgU" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VR game</a> I do not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">want</em> VR to fail, obviously. My decision to build a launch title for PS4's Project Morpheus VR headset also illustrates that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I don’t think it will fail.</em> I’ve been making games for 15 years and I really do have high hopes for VR. </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, I will also admit and even embrace that I don’t really know <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what</em> will happen with VR. There are too many dynamics at play and so much we do not understand. We have not seen an invention as significant as VR since, well, probably the iPhone but more likely moving pictures. </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The reason I’m writing this though is because I think Walker’s article deserves a long form response from someone working in VR every day.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">VR is a new medium. It begs for new creations to be made specifically for it. The ultimate failure of 3D Television is a point of comparison in the article. The problem with this is that 3DTV is not a medium but simply a new way of viewing an existing one. I am not aware of a single creative work that was fundamentally authored for only 3DTV such that it was not also viewable on a 2D TV. That technology is augmentative rather than transformative. Experiencing VR content on the other hand is fundamentally different and often mutually exclusive from standard TV. 3DTV and VR actually have little in common and the article’s point should be disregarded.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The line “VR replaces the role of the imagination” from the article is just as absurd as saying the same about photography, theatre, conversation and people. These are elements of experience that fall outside of a traditional screen and are quite comfortable there. The line in context gives games on standard screens exclusive domain over our imaginations. Nobody would argue that point in isolation and it doesn’t make any more sense as part of this article about VR.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Then there’s the point on price, which is deftly paired with the categorization of VR as a peripheral. You can say that all you want, but a VR headset is no more a peripheral than your television is. It is a brand new doorway through which you can step through. For that matter, many people will look at the headset as the focal point and the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">computer as the peripheral</em>. That’s how much more important it is than what’s typically thought of as a peripheral like a Wii Fit. How much did your TV cost? </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">And then we come to the crescendo of the piece — the complaint that despite all that was written, it is actually about the games. His logic is that there will not be enough AAA VR games because of risk, standard games will get half-hearted VR modes, and the medium will die a quick death because it never reaches critical mass. He says there will be small indie games but Kinect had that too and look what difference it made.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Well try this on then. Let’s say that critical mass actually does <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">not come from AAA games.</em> Let’s say it comes from somewhere completely unexpected. Maybe social VR ends up being unbelievably new and amazing. Maybe watching films in VR gains enough mass market traction. Maybe some indie does something amazing that gains critical mass (can you imagine???). It’s likely going to be a combination and interaction of all of these and more. </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The one thing that I REALLY REALLY believe is that VR is totally new and we are just getting started with it. Remember when the iPhone came out and multitouch screens weren’t completely understood? Then Angry Birds became a cultural phenomenon. This is like that times a hundred. Remember when the iPad was announced and everyone complained it was just a bigger iPhone? This is like that times a hundred. </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Most people cannot imagine what a new technology will bring them until it is demonstrated over and over again, often times refined and advertised and refined again. VR is so early. So if you want to say VR is risky, that nobody knows what VR is going to be like in 3 or 5 years… well I’m with you. We don’t. </p>
<p class="graf graf--p">What I do absolutely know is that now that I am in the throes of developing in VR, the possiblities feel so vast and so interesting, how could you not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">want</em> it to succeed? It’s as if we just discovered a new planet that could bear life. Why hope it leads to nothing? What’s the point of rooting against VR? That’s what I’d really like the gaming press to write about.</p>
